Wet snow sprays your face
The wind nips at your nose
Loud voices drown out the wind
Laughing faces crowd your vision

Voices call to each other across the streets
Christmas lights adorn every tree

Sounds of the city are drowned out 
By many voices of friends
Faces shine 
Under multicolored lights

The sun has set
The day is done
But the memories will carry on
