Wet snow sprays your face
The wind nips at your nose
But you are not cold
Many arms surround you 
Loud voices drown out the wind
Laughing faces crowd your vision

Ice bites your cheek again, and you laugh 
Hands appear and help you up
Blades cut into the ice around you
Lights reflect off the silvery surface 
And you start to skate again

Voices call to each other across the streets
Christmas lights adorn every tree
You stop to admire them, then continue on
Wind flying across your face

Quiet murmurs are drowned out 
By many voices of friends
Your food arrives
Noodles drowning in savory broth
Faces shine 
In the warm lighting

You’re warm and full
Strolling across slick floors
Of the mall
You’re surrounded by people
The day is done
But the fun?
Never.
